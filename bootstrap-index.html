          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>I have always been interested in solving problems and thinking of creative solutions so when I found GA, it was the perfect way to pivot into a new career. I really enjoyed making interactive web apps and seeing other people use them, it gives you a sense of fulfillment that my previous roles could not match. I have enjoyed learning new technologies giving me the tools to make my own stuff. Once I have finished I plan to create some engaging apps that will enhance my online business.</p>

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>This was our first project on the course so the idea was taken from the classic Countdown conundrum game as seen on TV currently presented by Nick Hewer assisted by Rachel Riley.This version of the conundrum has an animal theme where every conundrum is a single animal word. Each screen also has a different animal skin background implying the animal theme through out the game. The word length can be determined at the start of the game henceforce providing the four difficulty levels eg. EASY = 3 to 5 letter animal words, MEDUIM = 6 to 8 letter animal words, HARD = 9 to 10 letter animal words and IMPOSSIBLE = 11+ letter animal words</p>
          <h1>Favourite Bit</h1>
          <p>The sound that it plays when you guess a correct word. The game turned out to be strangely very addictive and im proud to have made it fully responsive too.</p>

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>This website takes the car rental theme but with an added twist. The idea is that super car owners in London may want to drive other supercars. This evolved into a supercar swap club, where paid members would be able to contact each other and arrange to swap supercars in London. I kept the locality to London, as I didnt think that a supercar car swap would work if the distance was too great. This version concentrates on London, but this could easily be replicated to other cities so members would have access to local supercars in their area.</p>

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>Our idea encompasses the current meetup phenomenon where it allows two individuals to meet and share a skill, eg if i wanted to improve my French I could use this app to find a native French speaker and offer to share a skill in return. Once registered, and then logged in, they can search for a skill and see the profiles of those users on a map. The map will show how far others are from your current location and you can also filter by distance.</p>

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>This app allows my customers to add their personal number plates to an online auction. Potential buyers can then put a bid on a plate, before the timer runs out. You can view the auction without registering, but you can only bid on a plate once you have registered.</p>

          <p>Creating a new auction platform that my customers requested and want to use. Once I have fully completed the auction functionality, created a messaging system, re-designed it so it looks similiar to my existing business and incorporated a payment facility then I am excitied to make this live for my customers and gather their feedback</p>
